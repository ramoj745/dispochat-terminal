It allows you to chat in real-time using your terminal, and it's compatible with the web version of the app.

Navigate to folder:
```bash
cd dispochat-terminal
```
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Running the App:
```bash
python app.py
```
Or run the distributable

./dist/DispoChat-Terminal.exe
```
